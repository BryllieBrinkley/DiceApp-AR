an augmented reality extension of my original DiceApp. With DiceApp-AR, you can now experience your favorite dice in stunning 3D! 
Simply tap anywhere on your screen to place as many 3D dice as you desire. 
Roll them individually or tap the "Roll All" button ("refresh" button, top-right corner) to roll them all simultaneously.

Through developing this app, I gained and solidified knowledge in various learning topics, including...

* How to setup and configure my projects for AR
* Creating 3D objects in augmented reality
* Finding and importing 3D models for AR
* How to detect horizontal planes in the real-world
* How to detect touch on real-world 3D objects
* How to place 3D objects onto a plane in the real-world by using Touch
* How to animate 3D objects in AR
* How to remove 3D objects from the AR Scene
* Refactoring my code for better readability
* Swift ARKit
* SceneKit
